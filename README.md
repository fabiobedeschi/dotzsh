# zsh configuration

My zsh configuration based on the awesome [zsh 4 humans](https://github.com/romkatv/zsh4humans)

## Install

Assuming your current shell is `zsh`:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/fabiobedeschi/dotzsh.git
cd dotzsh
ln -s $(pwd)/{.zshrc,.zshenv,.p10k.zsh,.zsh} $HOME
exec zsh
```
