# zsh configuration

My zsh configuration based on the awesome [zsh 4 humans](https://github.com/romkatv/zsh4humans)

## Install

Assuming your current shell is `zsh`:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/fabiobedeschi/dotzsh.git
cd dotzsh
chmod +x install update
./install
```

## Update

After the installation simply run:

```zsh
update_zsh
```

### Notes

- `z4h` keep his update mechanism separated. Fot this run `z4h update`
